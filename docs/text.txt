About Us

Hooks and Highs is about two men with white belt levels of expertise reaching black belt levels of shit-talking. All the while trying to make sense of the world, the music industry and mixed martial arts.

In the contemporary ocean of available podcasts one thing is direly missing – the voice of insanity. Who really talks for the confused, drunk and poorly educated? – I guess it’s us then.
